                <h3>Why You Should Learn Git And Github?</h3>
                <h4>What is Git?</h4>
                <p class="detail2">Git is a Version Control System (VCS). On a very basic level, there are two awesome things a VCS allows you to do: You can track changes in your files, and it simplifies working on files and projects with multiple people. There are multiple Version Control Systems, but Git is by far and large the most popular — both for individual and company use.</p>
                <p class="detail2">On the other hand, GitHub is a web based Git repository. It provides a free and easy place to use Git, the cloud to store your code in, and it allows you to interact with other developers on Open Source projects.</p>
                <h4>Why Use Git and GitHub?</h4>
                <p class="detail2">Here are five reasons you should be using Git and GitHub:</p>
                <h5>1.Centralized cloud storage of your code</h5>
                <p class="detail2">Your code is always available to you. No matter what computer your using, or where you are. Hard Drive failure? No problem. All your code is backed up.</p>
                <h5>2.Version Control</h5>
                <p class="detail2">Every version of your code is also available to you. With Git, every time you commit your code, Git remembers what has changed since the last time you saved your code.</p>
                <h5>3.Working in teams</h5>
                <p class="detail2">Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in the project.</p>
                <h5>4.Open Source</h5>
                <p class="detail2">GitHub also helps the programmers to contribute to the open source projects such as linux, vlc player.</p>
                <h5>5.Going in Past</h5>
                <p class="detail2">GitHub allows you to look back on code you wrote . If you don't want  any feature currently made by you in the app then you can go to the previous version of the app easily.
